My prompting strategy focuses on creating clear, detailed, and context-aware instructions that help model generate accurate and relevant responses. Here are the key elements:

1. I aim for clear and precise instructions, minimizing ambiguity. This ensures that the model knows exactly what information or task is needed.

2. I use any known context (like the project details) to provide relevant guidance, making the response more tailored.

3. I often specify the model's role and other parameters to align the model’s tone and output style with the user’s needs.

This approach helps to generate responses that are accurate, relevant, and aligned with the expectations.
